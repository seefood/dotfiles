# Not Included

The following files and directories are not included because you should never push them to a pubic server.
YADM has a symetric encryption option but I don't trust this kind of a scheme enough for my needs.

homesick doesn't have that, and that's fine. I'll just have to copy these over from other machines after the config is done:

- .ssh
- .pastebinit.xml
- .gnupg/\*.gpg
- .netrc
- .pki
- .profile
- .config/asciinema/config
